boat sensor product internship report.
alright. im not gonna write this like an actual report till i finish it. then i will overhaul??is that the right word??

### ok. so

teacher liked my projects so he wanted me to make an electronic product for his boat company.

my task is to make an electronic to check gas data of three separate fuel compartments in a boat, give alarm if something goes wrong. i had arduino, my teacher gave me another board (LGT8F328P LQFP32 MiniEVB (or something like it-a replica?? idk)), saying it is super cheaper (and it is) and that some things took so much effort to get working. i was given two projects, namely, blink and serial output. serial doesnt work without configuring board and my teacher told me to use another library called digikeyboard. its like a hotkey thing able to send keys, but the library didnt really work (im suspecting because my board was different than theirs product) and seems the website of the company was shut down. (checked using archive.org). i followed [6 Simple Steps to get a LGT8F328P-based board running at 32MHz](https://github.com/RalphBacon/LGT8F328P-Arduino-Clone-Chip-ATMega328P?tab=readme-ov-file#6-simple-steps-to-get-a-lgt8f328p-based-board-running-at-32mhz) tutorial by [Ralph Bacon](https://github.com/RalphBacon) (thank you thank you thank you thank you) which helped with all the configuration. info online is otherways scarce (teacher didn't give producer company name)
